# 📚 Online Bookstore SQL Project

A complete MySQL project simulating an **Online Bookstore Database** for analyzing books, customers, and order transactions.  
This project demonstrates SQL database design, data import, and analytical querying for extracting real-world business insights.

## 🧩 Project Overview

The **Online Bookstore** database is designed to manage and analyze book sales and customer information.  
It contains three main tables — `Books`, `Customers`, and `Orders` — connected through primary and foreign key relationships.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Design a normalized relational database schema  
- Import and query large datasets efficiently  
- Generate insights like revenue, top customers, and inventory status  
- Apply aggregation, joins, and filtering queries in SQL

## 💻 SQL Script Details

The main SQL file (`Project1.sql`) includes:

1. **Database Creation & Table Design**  
   - `Books`, `Customers`, and `Orders` tables with primary & foreign keys  
2. **Data Import Commands**  
   - Using `LOAD DATA INFILE` to import CSV datasets  
3. **Basic Analytical Queries**  
   - Filter books by genre, year, or price  
   - Retrieve customers from a specific country  
   - Calculate total revenue  
4. **Advanced Queries**  
   - Top-spending customers
